## Analysis of NOAA Storm events database

The basic goal of this assignment was to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. I used the database to answer the questions given below and show my code for the entire analysis. 

### Questions 
1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

### Data
